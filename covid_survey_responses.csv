This would be a huge drawback of virtual meetings for me - but one that can be overcome with planning and hopefully, a return to some sort of normality with respect to school and childcare."

I think that post-COVID I would still attend physical meetings that would help me to network, but would like also to able to virtually attend events that are not high in my interest list. Committing to record all future physical meetings is one solution even if virtual participation is not provided. "

While I've attended several interesting talks and meetings virtually in the COVID-era, I've also found my attention severely taxed - sitting behind my own laptop at home, it's much too easy to do other things and not really get the most out of the talk.

For me, a hybrid solution would be ideal; talks are streamed, but I could go to a local meeting with a few others (e.g. <1 travel) to watch the talks together. This would come with minimal CO2 and cost/time, while keeping the benefit of being concentrated for a meeting as well as some socializing and discussing the talks I've seen. I hope this format will take on, with many local hubs connected by video. This would surely beat meeting attendance at home for me."

My ability to focus on talks online is much less and my interactions with other scientists have been negligible. Typically, meetings have been an opportunity to get to know other people in the field and establish collaborations. This aspects of virtual meetings has been extremely disappointing. People need to think hard how to enable more virtual interactions beyond just the talks or posters."

So, I think it is unhelpful for any type of large conference format, especially for students looking for mentors or job opportunities."
